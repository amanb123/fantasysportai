# Fixes Applied - October 19, 2025

## Summary
Fixed multiple issues related to season handling and chat functionality for the 2025 NBA season.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. League Selection Season Mismatch
**Problem:** When selecting a 2025 league, the app showed "No leagues found for 2024"

**Root Cause:** 
- Hardcoded "2024" season references throughout the codebase
- Frontend displayed hardcoded "2024 season" message
- Backend defaults were set to 2024

**Fixes Applied:**

#### Frontend
- `frontend/src/components/LeagueSelection.jsx` (Line 177)
  - Changed: "You don't have any NBA fantasy leagues for the 2024 season on Sleeper."
  - To: "You don't have any NBA fantasy leagues on Sleeper for the current or past two seasons."

#### Backend
- `backend/config.py`
  - `SLEEPER_DEFAULT_SEASON`: Changed from "2024" to "2025"
  - `NBA_CURRENT_SEASON`: Changed from "2024" to "2025"

- `backend/.env`
  - `NBA_CURRENT_SEASON`: Changed from `2024` to `2025`

- `backend/services/sleeper_service.py`
  - `get_current_nba_season()`: Updated all default fallbacks from "2024" to "2025"
  - `get_user_leagues()`: Default season parameter changed from "2024" to "2025"

**Verification:** 
- Sleeper API `/v1/state/nba` correctly returns `"season": "2025"`
- Backend now auto-detects current season and fetches 2025, 2024, 2023 leagues
- User's 2025 league "Outside the NBA" now displays correctly

### 2. Roster API 500 Error
**Problem:** Getting rosters returned "500 Internal Server Error"

**Root Cause:**
```
1 validation error for SleeperRosterResponse
owner_id
  Input should be a valid string [type=string_type, input_value=None, input_type=NoneType]
```

Some rosters in Sleeper can have `owner_id = null` (orphaned/abandoned teams), but the Pydantic model required a non-null string.

**Fix Applied:**
- `backend/api_models.py` (Line 128)
  - Changed: `owner_id: str = Field(..., description="Sleeper user ID who owns this roster")`
  - To: `owner_id: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Sleeper user ID who owns this roster (can be None for orphaned teams)")`

**Verification:**
- Roster endpoint now returns 200 OK with 12 rosters
- Handles rosters with null owner_id gracefully

---

### 3. Chat Import Error
**Problem:** Chat functionality failed with error:
```
ImportError: cannot import name 'get_sleeper_service' from 'backend.dependencies'
```

**Root Cause:**
- `backend/main.py` tried to import `get_sleeper_service()` function
- Function didn't exist in `backend/dependencies.py`
- Only `sleeper_service` singleton instance was available

**Fix Applied:**
- `backend/dependencies.py` (After line 108)
  - Added new function:
```python
def get_sleeper_service():
    """
    Dependency to get the Sleeper service.
    
    Returns:
        SleeperService: Singleton Sleeper service instance
    """
    return sleeper_service
```

**Verification:**
- Chat now successfully initializes RosterAdvisorTools
- Function calling tools work properly
- No import errors

---

### 4. Chat Assistant Conversational Tone
**Problem:** Chat assistant needed to be more conversational and suggest next steps

**Enhancement Applied:**
- `backend/agents/agent_factory.py` - Updated `create_roster_advisor_agent()` system prompt

**Changes:**
1. **Tone:** More friendly and conversational ("like chatting with a knowledgeable friend")
2. **Behavior:** Only provide analysis when asked - don't volunteer unsolicited advice
3. **Response Format:** Always end with a helpful suggestion of what else the assistant can help with

**Example Suggestions:**
- "Want me to check the waiver wire for some [position] options?"
- "Curious about how your roster stacks up against an opponent?"
- "I can also check recent league moves if you'd like to see what others are doing."
- "Need help setting your lineup for this week?"
- "Should I look up any player stats or injury updates?"

## Notes

- The backend now auto-detects the current NBA season from Sleeper's `/v1/state/nba` endpoint
- When no season is specified in the API call, it fetches current season + previous 2 seasons
- All default fallbacks updated to 2025 for future-proofing
- Chat responses may vary based on which LLM is used (Ollama llama2 vs OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo)
