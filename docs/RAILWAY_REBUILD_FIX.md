# Railway Deployment Issue - APScheduler Missing

## 🔴 Problem
Backend crashed with:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'apscheduler'
```

## ✅ Solution Applied

Railway was using a cached build without the new APScheduler dependency. 

### What Was Done:
1. ✅ Verified `APScheduler==3.10.4` is in `backend/requirements.txt`
2. ✅ Made a small code change to trigger rebuild
3. ✅ Committed and pushed to dev (commit: `3b52b10`)
4. ✅ Merged to main (commit: `06bc989`)
5. ✅ Railway is now rebuilding with updated dependencies

## 🔍 How to Monitor

### Railway Dashboard
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Click on your backend service
3. Go to **"Deployments"** tab
4. Look for the latest deployment (should show "Building" or "Deploying")

### Expected Timeline
- **Build**: 1-2 minutes (Railway installs APScheduler)
- **Deploy**: 30 seconds (Railway starts the app)
- **Total**: ~2-3 minutes

### What to Look For in Logs

**During Build:**
```
Installing dependencies from requirements.txt
Collecting APScheduler==3.10.4
Successfully installed APScheduler-3.10.4
```

**After Successful Deployment:**
```
🏀 Starting Fantasy Basketball League API
🚀 Background scheduler started - Cache warmup every 5 minutes
🔄 [CRON] Running scheduled cache warmup...
✅ [CRON] Cache warmup job completed successfully
```

## ⚠️ If Still Failing

### Check 1: Verify requirements.txt
```bash
cat backend/requirements.txt | grep APScheduler
```
Should show: `APScheduler==3.10.4`

### Check 2: Force Railway Rebuild
In Railway dashboard:
1. Go to your backend service
2. Click **"Settings"**
3. Scroll to **"Redeploy"**
4. Click **"Redeploy"** button

### Check 3: Railway Build Logs
Look for this error in build logs:
```
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement APScheduler
```

If you see this, it means Railway couldn't install the package:
- Check requirements.txt syntax (no extra spaces)
- Verify package name is exactly: `APScheduler==3.10.4`

## 📊 Expected Status

### ✅ Success Indicators
- Railway deployment status: **Active** (green)
- Build logs show: **Successfully installed APScheduler**
- Runtime logs show: **Background scheduler started**
- No ModuleNotFoundError in logs

### ❌ Still Failing
If you still see `ModuleNotFoundError`:
1. Check Railway is deploying from the `main` branch
2. Verify the latest commit (`06bc989`) is being deployed
3. Clear Railway cache and redeploy manually

## 🎯 Current Status

- **Latest Commits**:
  - Dev: `3b52b10` - Trigger Railway rebuild for APScheduler dependency
  - Main: `06bc989` - Merge dev: Trigger Railway rebuild for APScheduler
  
- **Expected Result**: Railway rebuilding now with APScheduler included

- **ETA**: 2-3 minutes from push time

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Why This Happened
Railway caches builds for faster deployments. When we added APScheduler to requirements.txt, Railway may have used a cached build without reinstalling dependencies.

### The Fix
Making a code change (even just a comment) triggers Railway to do a fresh build, which forces it to reinstall all dependencies from requirements.txt, including the new APScheduler package.

### Prevention
Railway should automatically detect requirements.txt changes in the future. This was likely a one-time cache issue.
