# Railway Deployment - Quick Verification Checklist

## 🚀 Deployment Status

### Commits
- ✅ **Dev**: `493545a` - APScheduler implementation
- ✅ **Main**: `5ad5e2d` - Merged to production
- ✅ **GitHub**: Pushed successfully
- ⏳ **Railway**: Auto-deployment triggered

## ✅ What to Check After Deployment

### 1. Railway Deployment (1-2 minutes)
Go to: https://railway.app → Your Backend Service

Look for:
```
Build Status: ✓ Success
Deploy Status: ✓ Active
```

### 2. Railway Logs (Immediate)
Click "View Logs" and search for:

**Expected on Startup:**
```
🏀 Starting Fantasy Basketball League API
✅ Player cache is valid: 2009 players, TTL: 82951s
🚀 Background scheduler started - Cache warmup every 5 minutes
🔄 [CRON] Running scheduled cache warmup...
✅ [CRON] Cache warmup job completed successfully
```

**Expected Every 5 Minutes:**
```
🔄 [CRON] Running scheduled cache warmup...
[CRON] Player cache status: True (2009 players, TTL: 82951s)
[CRON] Redis: Connected ✅
✅ [CRON] Cache warmup job completed successfully
```

### 3. API Health Check (After Deployment)
```bash
curl https://fantasysportai-production.up.railway.app/api/warmup
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-30T20:30:00.000000",
  "status": "complete",
  "services": {
    "redis": "connected",
    "player_cache": {
      "status": "valid",
      "player_count": 2009,
      "ttl_remaining": 86000
    },
    "sleeper": "available",
    "nba_stats": "available"
  }
}
```

### 4. Frontend Verification (After Railway Deploys)
1. Go to: https://fantasysportai.vercel.app
2. Test features:
   - ✅ Roster Rankings (should load without timeout)
   - ✅ Free Agent Search (should complete in 2-3 seconds)
   - ✅ Roster Chat (should work without errors)
   - ✅ Current Matchup (should show player names, not IDs)

## 🔍 How to Monitor Scheduler

### Search Railway Logs
Filter by: `[CRON]`

You should see entries every 5 minutes:
```
20:00 - [CRON] Running scheduled cache warmup...
20:05 - [CRON] Running scheduled cache warmup...
20:10 - [CRON] Running scheduled cache warmup...
20:15 - [CRON] Running scheduled cache warmup...
```

### Check Cache TTL
The TTL (time-to-live) should never drop below ~21 hours (75,600s) because the scheduler refreshes every 5 minutes:

```
Player cache TTL: 86400s (24 hours) - Just refreshed
Player cache TTL: 86100s (23.9 hours) - After 5 min
Player cache TTL: 85800s (23.8 hours) - After 10 min
... scheduler refreshes cache before it expires
```

## 🎯 Success Indicators

### All Systems Operational
- 🟢 Railway deployment: Active
- 🟢 Scheduler: Running
- 🟢 Cache: Valid (2009 players)
- 🟢 Redis: Connected
- 🟢 Frontend: Loading fast
- 🟢 No timeouts on any features

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### If Scheduler Doesn't Start
**Check Railway Logs:**
```
Failed to start scheduler: <error>
```
**Solution**: Check that APScheduler is in requirements.txt and Railway rebuilt with new dependencies.

### If Jobs Don't Run
**Check Railway Logs:**
```
❌ [CRON] Cache warmup job failed: <error>
```
**Solution**: Check Redis connection and Sleeper API availability.

### If Cache Still Expires
**Check Railway Logs:**
```
[CRON] Player cache status: False (0 players, TTL: 0s)
[CRON] Player cache invalid, initializing...
```
**Solution**: Normal behavior - scheduler will auto-reinitialize. If this happens repeatedly, check Sleeper API status.

## 📊 Performance Metrics

### Before Scheduler
- Cache expires every 24 hours → Cold starts
- First request after expiry: 30-60s timeout
- Manual warmup required

### After Scheduler
- Cache refreshed every 5 minutes → Always warm
- All requests: 1-3s response time
- Zero manual intervention needed

## 🎉 Deployment Complete!

Once you see these in Railway logs, you're all set:
```
✅ Database connection established successfully
✅ Redis connection established successfully
✅ Player cache is valid: 2009 players
🚀 Background scheduler started - Cache warmup every 5 minutes
🔄 [CRON] Running scheduled cache warmup...
✅ [CRON] Cache warmup job completed successfully
```

---

**Next Steps:**
1. ✅ Wait 1-2 minutes for Railway deployment
2. ✅ Check Railway logs for scheduler startup
3. ✅ Test warmup endpoint with curl
4. ✅ Verify frontend performance
5. ✅ Monitor logs for 15 minutes to see 3 cron runs
6. 🎊 Celebrate - your app is now production-ready!
