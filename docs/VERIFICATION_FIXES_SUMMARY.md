# Verification Comments Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented 5 verification comments to improve robustness, error handling, and functionality of the roster chat feature.

## ✅ Comment 1: Historical Player-Name Extraction for Lowercase Queries

### Problem
Player name extraction failed for lowercase queries (e.g., "lebron james") because it only looked for capitalized words.

### Solution
**File**: `backend/services/roster_context_builder.py`

1. Enhanced `_extract_player_name()` method:
   - Added fallback logic for lowercase names
   - Finds longest two alphabetic tokens and title-cases them
   - Example: "lebron james stats" → "Lebron James"

2. Enhanced `_fetch_historical_stats_if_needed()`:
   - Added raw query fallback if name extraction fails
   - Tries `search_player_by_name()` with the full query string
   - Logs successful fallback attempts

### Impact
- Queries like "how did lebron james do in 2022" now work
- More forgiving user input handling
- Better logging for debugging

## ✅ Comment 2: Date-Range Historical Averages Include Shooting Percentages

### Problem
`_calculate_date_range_averages()` omitted FG%, 3P%, and FT% calculations, but `_format_historical_stats()` tried to display them.

### Solution
**File**: `backend/services/nba_stats_service.py`

Updated `_calculate_date_range_averages()` to:
- Accumulate shooting stats (fgm, fga, fg3m, fg3a, ftm, fta)
- Calculate weighted percentages across all games:
  - `fg_pct = (total_fgm / total_fga) * 100`
  - `fg3_pct = (total_fg3m / total_fg3a) * 100`
  - `ft_pct = (total_ftm / total_fta) * 100`
- Handle division by zero gracefully

### Impact
- Historical stats now include accurate shooting percentages
- Consistent data format across all stat types
- More complete player analysis for LLM

## ✅ Comment 3: Ensure Roster and Matchup Caches Before Building Context

### Problem
Roster and matchup data not guaranteed to be cached before context building, causing empty sections in LLM context.

### Solution
**File**: `backend/main.py`

Updated both `start_roster_chat()` and `send_chat_message()` endpoints:

```python
# Ensure rosters are cached
cached_rosters = league_cache.get_cached_rosters(league_id)
if not cached_rosters:
    logger.info(f"Rosters for league {league_id} not cached, fetching now")
    await league_cache.cache_rosters(league_id)

# Pre-warm matchup cache for current week
try:
    current_week = league_cache.get_current_nba_week()
    if current_week:
        cached_matchups = league_cache.get_cached_matchups(league_id, current_week)
        if not cached_matchups:
            logger.info(f"Matchups for league {league_id} week {current_week} not cached, fetching now")
            await league_cache.cache_matchups(league_id)
except Exception as matchup_error:
    logger.warning(f"Could not pre-warm matchup cache: {matchup_error}")
```

### Impact
- Roster context always includes complete roster data
- Matchup information available for weekly analysis
- Graceful degradation if matchup fetch fails
- Better LLM responses with complete context

## ✅ Comment 4: Enhanced Season Parsing for Ranges

### Problem
Season parsing failed for explicit ranges like "2022-23" or "2021-22" and could produce wrong seasons for ambiguous phrasing.

### Solution
**File**: `backend/services/roster_context_builder.py`

Enhanced `_extract_season()` with multi-format support:

```python
def _extract_season(self, query: str) -> Optional[str]:
    """
    Extract season year from query with enhanced parsing.
    
    Handles multiple formats:
    1. Explicit ranges: "2022-23", "2021-22" → returns as-is
    2. Single years: "2022", "2021" → converts to NBA season format (2021-22)
    3. Ambiguous phrasing: Falls back to year conversion
    """
    # First, look for explicit season ranges like "2022-23"
    range_match = re.search(r'\b(20\d{2})[-–](20)?\d{2}\b', query)
    if range_match:
        # Normalize to YYYY-YY format
        # ...
        return f"{start_year}-{end_year}"
    
    # Fallback: single year conversion
    # ...
```

### Impact
- Handles "2022-23 season" correctly
- Handles "2022 stats" → "2021-22 season"
- Supports both hyphen and en-dash separators
- Comprehensive inline documentation

## ✅ Comment 5: Graceful Degradation When nba_api Unavailable

### Problem
System failed completely if `nba_api` library was unavailable, rather than degrading gracefully.

### Solution
**Files**: 
- `backend/dependencies.py`
- `backend/services/roster_context_builder.py`

1. **Updated `get_roster_context_builder()` in dependencies.py**:
```python
# NBAStatsService is optional - allow graceful degradation
if not nba_stats:
    logger.warning("NBAStatsService unavailable - historical stats will be disabled")

# Create service (nba_stats can be None)
_roster_context_builder = RosterContextBuilder(
    player_cache_service=player_cache,
    league_data_cache_service=league_cache,
    nba_cache_service=nba_cache,
    nba_stats_service=nba_stats,  # Can be None
    basketball_repository=repository
)
```

2. **Updated `RosterContextBuilder.__init__()`**:
```python
def __init__(
    self,
    # ...
    nba_stats_service: Optional[NBAStatsService],  # Now Optional
    # ...
):
    self.nba_stats = nba_stats_service  # Can be None
    # Disable historical stats if service unavailable
    self.enable_historical_stats = settings.ROSTER_CHAT_ENABLE_HISTORICAL_STATS and (nba_stats_service is not None)
```

3. **Updated `_fetch_historical_stats_if_needed()`**:
```python
async def _fetch_historical_stats_if_needed(self, query: str) -> Optional[str]:
    try:
        # Check if NBA stats service is available
        if not self.nba_stats:
            logger.warning("Historical stats requested but NBAStatsService unavailable")
            return None
        # ... rest of method
```

### Impact
- System continues working without `nba_api`
- Historical stats disabled gracefully
- Clear logging about degraded functionality
- Better resilience to dependency issues

## 🔧 Bonus Fix: Code Duplication in agent_factory.py

### Problem
`SimpleAssistantAgent` class was defined twice in the file, causing ~130 lines of duplication.

### Solution
Removed the first (older) definition and kept only the enhanced version with:
- Better error handling
- Emoji logging (🦙, ✅, ⚠️, 🔄, ❌)
- Detailed error messages for both Ollama and OpenAI failures
- Helpful user-facing error messages

### Impact
- File size reduced from 590 to ~460 lines
- Cleaner, more maintainable code
- No duplicate imports or logic
- Single source of truth for LLM integration
