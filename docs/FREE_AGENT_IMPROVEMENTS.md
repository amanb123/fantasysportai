# Free Agent Search Improvements - Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend: Quick Action Buttons (RosterChat.jsx)
**Removed:**
- 🏥 Injury Check button
- 📊 Top Performers button

**Kept:**
- 🔍 Find Free Agents button
- ⭐ Lineup Advice button

These buttons populate the chat input with pre-written prompts for easy access to key features.

### 2. Backend: Season Logic Fix (tools.py)
**Problem:** The code was using 2024-25 season when it should be using 2025-26.

**Fix:**
```python
# Now correctly determines current NBA season
# October 22, 2025 → 2025-26 season (correct!)
if current_date.month >= 10:  # Oct-Dec: current year is season start
    season_year = current_date.year
else:  # Jan-Sep: previous year was season start
    season_year = current_date.year - 1
current_season = f"{season_year}-{str(season_year + 1)[-2:]}"  # "2025-26"
```

Added logging: `Free agent search using current NBA season: 2025-26`

### 3. Backend: Enhanced Injury-Adjusted Calculations
**What Changed:**
- Now stores `original_score` before applying injury penalties
- Shows before/after scores when injury adjustments are made
- More detailed explanations of how rankings work

**Example Output:**
```
1. **Player Name** (PG) - GSW
   📊 2024-25 Stats: 25.3 PPG, 5.2 RPG, 7.1 APG
   ⭐ Fantasy Score: 45.8 → **13.7** (injury-adjusted)
   📰 **ESPN Report:** Out - Ankle sprain
   🚨 **Risk Assessment:** Currently Out - High risk
```

**Credibility Features:**
1. **Transparent Calculations**: Shows original score → adjusted score
2. **Real-time ESPN Data**: Displays actual ESPN injury reports
3. **Clear Risk Assessment**: Explains why score was adjusted
4. **Detailed Formula**: Shows how fantasy scores are calculated

### 4. Improved Bottom Explanation

**Old:**
```
💡 Fantasy Score Formula: PTS + 1.2×REB + 1.5×AST + 3×STL + 3×BLK - TOV
⚕️ Injury Adjustments: Out (-70%), Doubtful (-40%), Questionable (-15%), Season-ending (removed)
📰 Injury Data: Real-time ESPN.com reports • Updated throughout the day
```

**New:**
```
💡 How Rankings Work:
• Base score uses 2025-26 NBA stats: PTS + 1.2×REB + 1.5×AST + 3×STL + 3×BLK - TOV
• ESPN injury data adjusts scores: Out (-70%), Doubtful (-40%), Questionable (-15%)
• Season-ending injuries are excluded from recommendations

```

   - Clear explanation at bottom

## Technical Details

**Files Modified:**
1. `frontend/src/components/RosterChat.jsx` - Quick action buttons
2. `backend/agents/tools.py` - Season logic, injury calculations, output formatting

**Key Variables:**
- `original_score`: Stored before injury adjustments
- `fantasy_score`: Final score after injury penalties
- `injury_penalty`: Human-readable risk assessment
- `espn_injury`: Full ESPN injury data object

**Injury Penalty Logic:**
- Season-ending: `fantasy_score = -999` (filtered out)
- Out: `fantasy_score *= 0.3` (70% penalty)
- Doubtful: `fantasy_score *= 0.6` (40% penalty)
- Questionable: `fantasy_score *= 0.85` (15% penalty)

## Impact on User Experience

**Before:**
- No clear indication why rankings changed
- Unclear if injury data was being used
- No transparency in calculations

**After:**
- Users see exact impact of injuries on rankings
- Clear attribution to ESPN data source
- Builds trust through transparency
- Helps users make informed decisions

This approach positions the AI as a transparent, data-driven assistant rather than a "black box" recommender!
