### ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL/FAILED (6 tests)

4. **Season Context** (Partial - 2/4 keywords)
   - Query: "how many games have been played this season so far?"
   - Result: ‚ö†Ô∏è Answered correctly but missing "just started"/"opening day" phrasing
   - Response: "The current date is October 22, 2025... no games have been played in the 2025-26 NBA season yet"
   - Issue: Expected more explicit "opening day" language

5. **Player Current Season Stats** (Failed - 0/2 keywords)
   - Query: "show me Anthony Davis's stats this season"
   - Result: ‚ùå Did NOT call `get_player_season_stats` tool
   - Response: "He is active... If you would like to see his season statistics, I can provide that"
   - **Critical Issue:** Should have proactively called the tool

6. **Player Last Game Calculation** (Partial - 5/6 keywords)
   - Query: "show me how you calculated LeBron James's fantasy points from his last game"
   - Result: ‚ö†Ô∏è Used season averages instead of actual game log
   - Response: Showed calculation using 2024-25 season averages
   - **Critical Issue:** Should fetch actual last game stats from game log

7. **Free Agent Search** (Partial - 1/4 keywords)
   - Query: "who are the best available centers?"
   - Result: ‚ùå Called tool but SUMMARIZED output instead of showing full details
   - Response: Listed players but missing PPG, RPG, ESPN injury data
   - **CRITICAL ISSUE:** This is the main problem we've been trying to fix
   - Expected: Full formatted output with stats, injury adjustments, methodology

8. **Opponent Roster** (Partial - 1/2 keywords)
   - Query: "who am I playing this week and what's their roster?"
   - Result: ‚ö†Ô∏è Tool call failed/errored

   - Query: "who owns Stephen Curry?"
   - Result: ‚úÖ Correctly called `search_player_details` tool
   - Response: "Stephen Curry is currently owned by the fantasy team 'zzzprince'"
   - Minor: Missing "roster" keyword but functionally correct

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. **Free Agent Search Output Summarization** (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
**Status:** Still broken despite previous fixes  
**Problem:** The LLM is summarizing the tool output instead of presenting it verbatim
- System message says: "Present the tool's output EXACTLY as returned"
- Tool description says: "Return EXACTLY as provided - Do NOT summarize"
- **LLM is still summarizing anyway**

**Expected Output:**
```
======================================================================
üèÄ TOP 10 AVAILABLE FREE AGENTS (Position: C)
======================================================================
‚ú® Rankings intelligently adjusted using real-time ESPN injury data

1. **Mark Williams** (C) - PHX
   üìä 2024-25 Stats: 12.0 PPG, 9.0 RPG, 1.0 APG
   ‚≠ê Fantasy Score: 28.5
   
[... full detailed output with ESPN injury data, methodology, etc.]
```

**Actual Output:**
```
Here are the top available centers:
1. **Mark Williams** (C) - PHX
2. **John Collins** (C/PF) - LAC
[... just names, no stats or methodology]
```

### 2. **Proactive Tool Calling**
**Problem:** LLM not calling tools when clearly needed
- Example: "show me Anthony Davis's stats" ‚Üí Should immediately call `get_player_season_stats`
- Instead: Asks if user wants stats

**Solution Needed:** Strengthen system message about being confident and proactive

### 3. **Game Log vs Season Averages**
**Problem:** When asked for "last game" calculation, uses season averages
- Query: "show me how you calculated LeBron's fantasy points from his last game"
- Expected: Fetch game log, show actual last game stats
- Actual: Used 2024-25 season averages

**Solution Needed:** Better prompt understanding of "last game" vs "season averages"

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Action:** Fix free agent search output presentation
   - Consider post-processing: Inject raw tool output after LLM response
   - Alternative: More explicit system message examples
   - Last resort: Different prompt structure for tool output preservation

2. **Short Term:** Improve proactive tool calling
   - Add examples in system message of when to call tools immediately
   - Reduce "ask permission" behavior

3. **Medium Term:** Improve game log fetching
   - When "last game" is mentioned, prioritize game logs over season stats
   - Add specific instructions about game-by-game vs aggregated stats

## Next Steps

- [ ] Investigate why tool output preservation isn't working despite explicit instructions
- [ ] Consider implementing post-processing to inject raw tool outputs
- [ ] Add more specific examples to system message
- [ ] Test with different LLM models/temperatures to see if behavior differs
